 *      bilinear.c
 *
 *      Perform bilinear transformation on s-domain coefficients
 *      of 2nd order biquad section.
 *      First design an analog filter and use s-domain coefficients
 *      as input to szxform() to convert them to z-domain.
 *
 * Here's the butterworth polinomials for 2nd, 4th and 6th order sections.
 *      When we construct a 24 db/oct filter, we take to 2nd order
 *      sections and compute the coefficients separately for each section.
 *
 *      n       Polinomials
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      2       s^2 + 1.4142s +1
 *      4       (s^2 + 0.765367s + 1) (s^2 + 1.847759s + 1)
 *      6       (s^2 + 0.5176387s + 1) (s^2 + 1.414214 + 1) (s^2 + 1.931852s + 1)
 *
 *      Where n is a filter order.
 *      For n=4, or two second order sections, we have following equasions for each
 *      2nd order stage:
 *
 *      (1 / (s^2 + (1/Q) * 0.765367s + 1)) * (1 / (s^2 + (1/Q) * 1.847759s + 1))
 *
 *      Where Q is filter quality factor in the range of
 *      1 to 1000. The overall filter Q is a product of all
 *      2nd order stages. For example, the 6th order filter
 *      (3 stages, or biquads) with individual Q of 2 will
 *      have filter Q = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
 *
 *      The nominator part is just 1.
 *      The denominator coefficients for stage 1 of filter are:
 *      b2 = 1; b1 = 0.765367; b0 = 1;
 *      numerator is
 *      a2 = 0; a1 = 0; a0 = 1;
 *
 *      The denominator coefficients for stage 1 of filter are:
 *      b2 = 1; b1 = 1.847759; b0 = 1;
 *      numerator is
 *      a2 = 0; a1 = 0; a0 = 1;
 *
 *      These coefficients are used directly by the szxform()
 *      and bilinear() functions. For all stages the numerator
 *      is the same and the only thing that is different between
 *      different stages is 1st order coefficient. The rest of
 *      coefficients are the same for any stage and equal to 1.
 *
 *      Any filter could be constructed using this approach.
